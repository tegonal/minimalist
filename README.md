# Minimalist

![Minimalist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/minimalist/main/.idea/icon.png) M like Minimalist,
a library which helps you in setting up parameterized tests and prioritise them in case you don't have enough time
to execute all of them.

Although it might resemble a property based testing library, its focus is on tests that take longer
(integration, e2e and system integration tests) and is more data-driven oriented.
